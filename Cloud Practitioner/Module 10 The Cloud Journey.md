# Module 10 The Cloud Journey

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework

**Operational Excellence** : This pillar focuses on running, monitoring, and continually improving systems, with key principles including "operations as code," documentation, and the ability to anticipate and recover from failures.

**Security** : It emphasizes protecting information, systems, and assets through best practices like automating security, applying security at all layers, and securing data in transit and at rest.

**Reliability** : This pillar relates to a system's ability to recover from disruptions, scale dynamically, and mitigate issues. It includes testing recovery procedures, horizontal scaling, and automated failure recovery.

**Performance Efficiency** : Performance efficiency involves using computing resources effectively to meet system requirements and maintaining efficiency as demands change. It encourages experimenting, using serverless architectures, and being able to scale globally.

**Cost Optimization** : Cost optimization focuses on delivering business value at the lowest cost by adopting a consumption model, analyzing expenditures, and leveraging managed services to reduce ownership costs.

**Sustainability** : Introduced in December 2021, this pillar is about improving sustainability by reducing energy consumption, setting goals, maximizing resource utilization, adopting efficient hardware and software, and reducing the environmental impact of cloud workloads.
