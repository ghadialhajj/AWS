# Module 8 Pricing and Support

## AWS Free Tier

The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. Three types of offers are available: Always Free, 12 Months Free, and Trials.

## How AWS pricing works

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Pay for **what you use** : for each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.

Pay less **when you reserve** : some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

Pay less with **volume-based discounts when you use more** : some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

The AWS **Pricing Calculator** (this is different from Cost Explorer) lets you explore AWS services, create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS (based on the used specs), and organize your AWS estimates by groups.

## Billing Dashboard

Use the AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs.

## Consolidated Billing

The **consolidated billing** feature of AWS Organizations enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your **organization** so you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization.

On your monthly bill, you can review itemized charges incurred by each account to enable greater transparency into your organization's accounts while still maintaining the convenience of receiving a single monthly bill.

Another benefit of consolidated billing is the ability to share bulk discount pricing, Savings Plansâ€¦ across the accounts in your organization, when one account does not have enough monthly usage to qualify for a discount but the accounts combined qualify for a benefit that applies across all accounts in the organization.

## AWS Budgets

In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations, review how much cost your predicted AWS usage will incur by the end of a period, and set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.

## AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. It also includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. _It is a__historical analysis tool_.

By analyzing your AWS costs over time, you can make informed decisions about future costs and how to plan your budgets.

## AWS Cost and Usage Reports

AWS CUR provides the most detailed billing data of any AWS cost management tool, including information about usage of AWS services, such as the number of hours of usage, data transfer, as well as cost information, including total costs and costs for each service, account, and region. It is more granular than AWS Cost Explorer.
