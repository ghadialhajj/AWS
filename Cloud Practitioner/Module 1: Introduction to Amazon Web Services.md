# Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services

## Introduction

AWS offers services ranging from basic elements like compute, storage, and network security to complex solutions like BC, AI, ML

Modern computing centers around a client-server mode. In AWS, the server is represented by an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, which is like a virtual server.

One key concept of AWS is that you only pay for what you use, contrasting with traditional on-premises data centers where capacity is fixed, so you can scale up or down with a click.

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of **IT resources** over the internet **with pay-as-you-go pricing**, so it's more than just computing without on-premise (also called private cloud deployment) data centers.

**On-demand delivery** means you can get resources like virtual servers and storage when you need them without advance notice so you can easily scale up or down as your needs change, unlike managing your own data centers.

AWS aims to handle common and time-consuming tasks, allowing you to focus on unique aspects of your business.

Resources are accessible **over the internet** , either through a secure webpage console or programmatically

Pay-as-you-go pricing means you only pay for the resources you use.

### Benefits of cloud computing:

**Trade upfront expense for variable expense** : Cloud computing allows companies to move from investing heavily in upfront expenses like data centers and physical servers to paying only for the computing resources they actually use, reducing costs and enabling innovative solutions.

**Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers** : Cloud computing lets companies focus less on managing infrastructure and servers and more on applications and customers, saving both money and time.

**Stop guessing capacity** : With cloud computing, there's no need to predict infrastructure capacity in advance. Resources can be launched when needed, scaling up or down as demand changes, eliminating the need to pay for unused resources.

**Benefit from massive economies of scale** : Cloud providers like AWS can offer lower costs due to economies of scale resulting from aggregating usage from many customers, resulting in lower pay-as-you-go prices.

**Increase speed and agility** : Cloud computing's flexibility allows for faster development and deployment of applications, providing more time for experimentation and innovation compared to traditional data center computing.

**Go global in minutes** : The AWS Cloud's global footprint allows for quick deployment of applications to customers worldwide with low latency, ensuring access with minimal delays, regardless of geographical location.
